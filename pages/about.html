                <p>Hi, I’m Jake Covington, a web developer who began my journey in early 2024. Over time, I’ve gained a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. I focus on creating responsive and user-friendly websites with a modern design approach, utilizing techniques like Flexbox and Grid.</p>
                <p>In addition to web development, I have a diverse background in surveying and farm operations. Currently, I work as a Survey Party Chief, where I’ve developed strong technical and leadership skills. I also co-own and manage Covington Farm, overseeing land development and heavy equipment operations. My past roles include working as a Survey Technician and an Assistant to Owner/Truck Driver, securing heavy equipment and assisting with transport logistics.</p>                  
                <p>I’m committed to delivering high-quality work that meets business needs, and I’m always eager to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
